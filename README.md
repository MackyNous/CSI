# Cybersecurity Services Infrastructure (CSI) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MackyNous/CSI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MackyNous/CSI)

CSI is a distributed (service-oriented) infrastructure ***intended solely for 
educational purposes*** (and should never be used in a production environment).

At the core is a generic REST server that accepts server specifications,
which are then executed to start what we call **subservers**.
**IMPORTANT NOTE**: this server accepts and executes executable
JavaScipt code. This approach is suitable in our context of education,
but should never be used in a production environment.

The file launcher.js launches a number of services, including

* YellowPages: a subscription service where services can find eachother
	* provide: here, a server describes a service that it offers.
	* require: here, a server describes all services that it needs.  
		For each required service, the requestor will receive a /fulfill message describing  
		a provider (either immediately or as soon as the service is 'provided')
* IDManager: a service persisting user names and hashed passwords
	* verify: check if the offered credentials are bona fide
* AccessManager: a service which checks access rights/roles
	* verify: checks if a user has the required right/role
* Login: allows users to log in on HTML pages
	* keyexchange: create secure communication (shared secret)
	* login: secure login

## Getting Started [local] ![node (tag)](https://img.shields.io/node/v/passport/latest.svg) 

See generic info on cloning a github repo

### Prerequisites 

Recent node.js, see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)

e.g. download Win msi, Mac pkg or tarball

#### modules

### Installing

```
In DEV: MySQL setup section. 
```

install npm and run the script (debian as an example): 
```zsh
$ sudo apt install npm
$ npm install 
$ npm start
```
Last step is to visit `jsoneditor.html` and press `login`

(currently jsoneditor has dummy data and doesn't do much

## Getting Started [Docker] ![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/jrottenberg/ffmpeg.svg) 

First we need to install docker to run everything:

For Debian based systems:
```zsh
sudo apt install docker

# Start docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Test if docker works correctly
sudo docker run hello-world
```

For Arch based systems:
```zsh
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S docker

# Start docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Test if docker works correctly
sudo docker run hello-world
```

For centOS based systems: 
```zsh
$ sudo yum install -y yum-utils \
  device-mapper-persistent-data \
  lvm2
  
$ sudo yum-config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
    
$ sudo yum install docker-ce

$ sudo systemctl start docker

# Test if docker works
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```
## Inventory Management System
Team VT03 has made beginning for a Inventory Management System. If you want to use this functionaliy you can follow these instructions:

First, move the content of the front-end folder and a copy of nocrypto.js into /var/www/html

Start apache2 service:
```zsh
$ sudo service apache2 start
```

Install some extra dependencies (if not present) inside the CSI folder 

Start genericServer.js and database.js:
```zsh
$ node genericServer.js
$ node launcher.js
$ node database.js

```

Last step is to visit http://127.0.0.1/login and try to login with root & secretPassword1
